Python


-Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

  This project was a prototype for a smart thermostat. In this mock trial I needed to wire and edit code that would allow the user to change from stagnant to heating mode and cooling mode. The system also required for the base temperature to be increased or decreased depending on button presses.

  
  
-What did you do particularly well?

The system functioned as intended. There were no notable issues with wireing the breadboard, nor any major code bugs that effected the functionality in any way.



-Where could you improve?

My state machine needs improvement. I believe that either my interpretation of how systems work or my presentation needs to change in order ot present better state machines.



-What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?

I enjoyed working with a raspberry Pi and intend on continueing with my learning with linux systems. 



-What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

Python coding, IOT understanding, and basic prototyping are all skills that will be useful in future employment with computer companies.



-How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

This project contained many notes that would allow future developers to see what I did and how I did it, allowing them to make changes or edit the code.
